### Predicting Peer-to-Peer Lending Systems Default Rate Prediction with Machine Learning

#### 1. Abstract
  
This project will investigate the P2P Lending Default predictions. The Project
examines the application of machine learning techniques for forecasting process. The topic was
chosen due to inevitable rise of fin-tech startups and industry being highlighted. Theoretical
information on the machine learning has been used to derive empirical results. The dissertation
will inform the reader on the literature review of the systematic work of the P2P Systems, the big
data cleaning and machine learning analysis

#### 2. Introduction
Peer to peer lending systems have become a huge phenomenon in the world. Although
the amount of credit available through peer-to-peer lending is minuscule in comparison to
traditional credit, the public attention given is significant. A lot of start -ups started to thrive in
the past years, as players in the industry hiked. People tend to break ties with the mainstream
financial industry and become acquainted with P2P Lending systems all around the world; but in
Turkey, P2P Lending phenomenon is a brand new term. The Turkish people familiarized with
crowdfunding but they haven’t met with crowd lending side of the scale. Peer to peer ecosystems
are complex by their nature because it lost its definition of “Exchange between individuals” as
the parties in the system grew by number with the developments in technology. The individuals
lost their places to hedge funds, banks and wealth management firms in the market nowadays.

Like peer-to-peer lending in its earlier form, crowdfunding (kickstarter or gofundme)
involves setting up an online profile where the person seeking funding can plead their
case/aims/background in a narrative form. The role of the crowdfunding site is to provide a
platform for connecting geographically dispersed funders to particular causes they care about.
The transparency of user information will lead to better scoring. Because many banks are
struggling with credit risk modeling due to missing data. P2P lending sites, Bondora and Lending
Club are revealing all their data sources to the public.

In this research, we decided to focus on data mining side of Peer to Peer Lending systems
aiming to establish machine learning models in order to estimate default probability of credits. R
program was used for data mining applications and data was obtained from Lending Club free
source. In this project report, we will first discuss the literature review and then default
forecasting processes. In order to forecast, data cleaning and data mining processes have been
accomplished. It will be further discussed in the following paragraphs.
